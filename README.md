# Python functional programming example

Functional Programming:

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computations as evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state change and mutable data. It is based on the concept of pure functions, which are functions that always produce the same result for the same input data and have no side effects. In functional programming, it emphasizes immutability and the use of higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments) to solve problems.

Example in Python:

Suppose we want to calculate the sum of the squares of the even numbers in a list. Here is an example of how we could solve this using functional programming in Python.

In this example, we have defined two functions: is_even to check if a number is even and square to calculate the square of a number. Then, we used the filter and map functions along with sum to apply functional programming and calculate the sum of the squares of the even numbers in the list.


Functional programming allows us to write code that is more concise, modular and easier to understand. It is based on sound mathematical concepts and can be especially useful in situations where you want to reduce errors and facilitate reasoning about the code.
